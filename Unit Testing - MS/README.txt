Test Calc
This program visits unit testing. Running the calc.py program will not work, but running the test_calc.py file will work.
----------------------------------------------------------
I didn't use the from calc.py import * because it's easier to keep track of whats from where.
I didn't add a whole lot of test cases either.
----------------------------------------------------------
Runs like normal, except in the calc.py file.
Values can be changed in the test_calc.py file, as long as the fit the equal and not equal criteria
----------------------------------------------------------
Whole purpose is to test unit testing, works like it should.
Input is tricky, so static inputs were settled with. They can still be changed inside of test_calc.py
