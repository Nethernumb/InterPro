Shape Calculator 
It just finds the area of shapes with predefined sizes for now
----------------------------------------------------------
At the top there MUST be: from shapecalc.shapes import *
it will allow seamless uses of the classes (or it should, anyways)
----------------------------------------------------------
Currently, running it you just run it like a regular program, or push F5
Values can be manually changed, will become inputs at a later date.
----------------------------------------------------------
Has the formulas for finding area of a Circle, square, triangle, and a trapezoid
Must be manually input if you want different values, input will be at a later time.
